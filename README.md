# Portfolio - Sreeram Marimuthu
Welcome to my personal portfolio website's repo, built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Vercel (LLM), and deployed via GitHub Pages. This website serves as a curated space for sharing my professional experience, projects, and publications, in data science, research, and AI.

## Methodology 
I built this portfolio website from scratch in 2 days using an online Large Language Model (via Vercel) to test how efficiently an LLM could help design a professional website. I used prompt engineering to structure the layout, and have been updating the content periodically since then.

## Built With
Next.js - Web framework  
TypeScript - Strong typing support  
Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS for responsive styling  
Prompt Engineering + LLMs - For platform generation and layout ideas  
Vercel & GitHub Pages - CI/CD & hosting pipeline  
GitHub Actions - Deployment  
Modular Components - Built from scratch for reusability and clarity

#### This repo is both an interesting personal experiment in LLM efficiency and a public-facing portfolio that clearly showcases my technical and research expertise.
